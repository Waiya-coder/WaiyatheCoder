## What Worked Well
  Table Layout for Image Grid: To arrange images in a grid format, I utilized HTML tables. Although modern web design often favors CSS Grid for such tasks, the use of tables was effective in this context, especially given the constraints of the assignment.

Image URL Parameters for Optimization: Incorporating parameters like w=1920&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format into image URLs proved beneficial. These parameters allowed for efficient image optimization by adjusting width (w), quality (q), fitting method (fit), and enabling automatic format selection (auto=format). 


## What Didn't
HTML Table Limitations: While tables provided a structured layout, they lacked the flexibility of modern CSS layout techniques, making responsive design more challenging. 
Image Sourcing Challenges: Finding high-quality images that matched the desired dimensions and aesthetic was time-consuming.

## Extra Credit
Accessibility Enhancements: I ensured that all images included descriptive alt text, improving accessibility for users utilizing screen readers.
